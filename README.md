# voting-system-blockchain
Blockchain idea for voting systems


Just a idea I am working on and once I have most of the idea and concept down, I am hoping for somebody way smarter than me to code it. Happy to assist with my project vision on this

---Start Voting Process---

---Define Token Generation-

- States issue tokens to US Citizens (SS# = Token) = SST (Social Security Token)

- SST can be registered to vote | Registrations = Voter Enabled Token (VET)

- VET is enable

- VET can be deregistered (death, gave up citizenship, felony...other laws?) DEREG-VET

- SST can be deregistered (death or gave up citizenship)

- Once SSTs are deregistered, SST is placed into cold storage for historic tracking only

- States validates # of Citizen Count (CC) vs Census Data (CD) vs Vote Eligible Persons (VEP) (AGE18-120 - Deaths - Felony - (others) = Current Vote Eligible Persons (CVEP)

---Anonymous Process---

To ensure anonymous and personal ID is protected Voter Enabled Tokens (VET):

- VET + Scrambled Prime Key Encryption (SPKE) = Anonymous Activated Voter Enabled Token â€“ (AAVET)

---Explain basic voting steps--

1. Citizen registers to vote.

2. Citizen visits voting center

3. Vote center clerks validates voter registration 

4. Citizen places ID on RFID Voting Process Unit (RFID-VPU) for processing

5. VET is detected

6. Vote clerk places Blank Reusable Voting Card (BRVC) on RFID-VPU

7. RFID-VPU activates BRVC and places AAVET on card

---break down tech process here later with pseudo code---

8. Voting Blockchain updates with a successful voting slot and waits for AAVET confirmation 

---break down TTL and other security here later---

9. Voter is handed BRVC

10. Voter walks into booth and places BVRC on vote machine

11. Voting Machine builds encrypted connection to Voting Blockchain

---break down TTL and additional securities here with pseudo code---

12. Voter selects desired vote(s)

13. Voting Machine registers vote(s) asks for confirmation 

14. Voter reviews vote(s) and confirms 

15. Voting Machine updates Voting Blockchain ledger and removes AAVET from BRVC

16. AAVET is locked into Voting Blockchain slot and unchangeable, Blockchain slot is closed.

17. Voting Blockchain ledger is updated

18. Voter is provided confirmation and display of vote listed within Voting Blockchain

19. Voting Machine has option to print paper ballot for turn in to Voting Clerk. (Confirmation, audits..etc)  

19. AAVET is 100% useless for additional voting since AAVET is no longer valid

---break down TTL/.SEC here later with pseudo code---

20. Voter removes BRVC and leaves booth

21. Voter returns BRVC for reissue to next voter

22. Vote clerk place BRVC on RFID Wipe Clean Verify System (RFID-WCVS)

23. BRVC is issued to next voter (rinse and repeat)

24. Voting stats are displayed publicly for all to see.
