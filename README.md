Blockchain idea for voting systems


Just a idea I am working on...

---Start Voting Process---

---Define Token Generation-
States issue tokens to US Citizens (SS# = Token) = SST (Social Security Token)
SST can be registered to vote | Registrations = Voter Enabled Token (VET)
VET is enable
VET can be deregistered (death, gave up citizenship, felony...other laws?) DEREG-VET
SST can be deregistered (death or gave up citizenship)
Once SSTs are deregistered, placed into cold storage for historic tracking only

States validates # of Citizen Count (CC) vs Census Data (CD) vs Vote Eligible Persons (VEP) (AGE18-120 - Deaths - Felony - (others) = Current Vote Eligible Persons (CVEP)

---Anonymous Process---
To ensure anonymous and personal ID is protected Voter Enabled Tokens (VET):
VET + Scrambled Prime Key Encryption (SPKE) = Anonymous Active Voter Enabled Token â€“ (AAVET)

---Explain basic voting steps--
Citizen registers to vote.
Citizen visits voting center
Vote center clerks validates registration 
Citizen places ID on RFID Voting Process Unit (RFID-VPU) for processing
VET is detected
Vote clerk places Blank Reusable Voting Card (BRVC) on RFID-VPU
RFID-VPU activates BRVC and places AAVET on card

---break down tech process here later---
Voting Blockchain updates with successful voting slot and waits for AAVET

---break down TTL and other security here later---
Voter is handed BRVC
Voter walks into booth and places BVRC on vote machine
Voting Machine builds encrypted connection to Vote Blockchain

---break down TTL and additional securities here---
Voter selects desired vote(s)
Voting Machine registers vote(s) asks for confirmation 
Voter reviews vote(s) and confirms 
Voting Machine updates Voting Blockchain ledger by removing AAVET from BRVC
AAVET is locked into Voting Blockchain slot and unchangeable
Voting Blockchain ledger is updated
Voter is provided confirmation and display of vote listed within Voting Blockchain
AAVET is 100% useless for additional voting since AAVET is no longer valid

---break down TTL/.SEC here later---
Voter removes BRVC and leaves booth
Voter returns BRVC for reissue to next voter
Vote clerk place BRVC on RFID Wipe Clean Verify System (RFID-WCVS)
BRVC is issued to next voter (rinse and repeat)

Voting stats are displayed publicly for all to see.
